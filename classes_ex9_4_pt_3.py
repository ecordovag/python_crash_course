# 9-4. Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 162).
# Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment
# the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any number
# you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of
# business.
