# 10-10. Common Words: Visit Project Gutenberg (https://gutenberg.org ) and find a few texts youâ€™d like to analyze. 
# Download the text files for these works, or copy the raw text from your browser into a text file on your computer.
# You can use the count() method to find out how many times a word or phrase appears in a string.
# Write a program that reads the files you found at Project Gutenberg and determines how many times the word 'the' 
# appears in each text. This will be an approximation because it will also count words such as 'then' and 'there'. 
# Try counting 'the ', with a space in the string, and see how much lower your count is.
